# PhoneNumberFormatting
For ensuring that all numbers start with +61 so that we can use Twilio and Amazon Connect. Create in this order - Phone Number Utilities first and Triggers last. Then run the tests. Create a test suite called PhoneNoFormatterTestSuite. Then to a Test Suite Run. If it passes then check in Sandbox on all objects and all phone number fields before creating an outbound change set. You may have to allow deployment from the Sandbox in production - go to setup - deployment settings - and allow. Then validate and run specified tests. Drop the test names into the box with a comma and no spaces (TestContactPhoneNoFormatter,TestAccPhNoFormatter,TestLeadPhNoFormatter). Once validation is successful, deploy, and then validate again. Ensure you always upload all 10 Apex Classes and Test Classes at once. This works for NEW orgs from an NPSP Trial.
